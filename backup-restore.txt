2013 version:
------------
Intro here:
https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789#.dor4dkliv

dotfiles all go on git in a .dotfiles folder.

Restore procedure:
1. Off network, download git from git-scm.com
1a. if an RD machine, clone git0.rd.bbc.co.uk:misc/dotfiles-conf
1a. set up ssh

Because of stubs, it looks like installing xcode and the dev tools is basically mandatory here.
Then open xcode to agree to the license.

2. From the terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrewGibb/dotfiles .dotfiles
$ cd .dotfiles

You must either connect over wifi or manually set the http proxy before you do this.

$ ./install.sh
 - Install Vundle using git from github. Use instructions you find there.
6. First-run setup for Vundle - open vim and do :PluginInstall
3. Manually install non-cask apps (see macapps.sh)
4. Manually install julia
4.5 open up Julia, do ENV["PYTHON"] = "" or similar, then Pkg.add("PyPlot")
5. from the terminal do
$ julia jpackages.jl
7. Add bits I think I need to BasicTex
8. Atom extensions
9. reinstall home, etc from backup
10. Configure
 - email
 - remote desktop
 -

To get the correct prompt, set hostname in Sys Prefs/Sharing, and also do
$ sudo scutil --set HostName <newname>

log in to dropbox & wait for sync
Install 1password
Install solarized from the web
install vundle from github

Try this to set up solarized in vim & tmux:
http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/10/17/vim-solarized-and-tmux/

install.sh:
-----------
- Symlinks ~/.whatever to ~/.dotfiles/topic/.whatever
 - .vim, .vimrc
 - .profile, .bashrc
 - .ssh (CONFIDENTIAL)
 - .gitconfig
 - .tmux.conf
- install homebrew
- install homebrew cask
- install applications

anything which you source must be executable, on Mac at least. 744 permissions

At some stage:
- setup github_rsa, id_rsa, beeb_rsa

homebrew cask doesn't allow updates. Junk this step.
Still need to:
 - firefox forge cert and password
 - PEM root cert or whatever it's called.

Ordering of git things. Signing in and out? ssh?


dotfiles.git
------------
Contains:
 - install.sh
 - all mac dotfiles
 - linux dotfiles (combine them?)

Things excluded:
proxy stuff
.npmrc
.npm
.julia
.julia_history
