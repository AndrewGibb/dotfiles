dotfiles all go on git in a .dotfiles folder.

Restore procedure:
1. Off network, download git from git-scm.com
1a. if an RD machine, clone git0.rd.bbc.co.uk:misc/dotfiles-conf
1a. set up ssh

Because of stubs, it looks like installing xcode and the dev tools is basically mandatory here.
Then open xcode to agree to the license.

2. From the terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrewGibb/dotfiles .dotfiles
$ cd .dotfiles

You must either connect over wifi or manually set the http proxy before you do this.

$ ./install.sh
3. Manually install non-cask apps (see macapps.sh)
4. Manually install julia
5. from the terminal do
$ julia jpackages.jl
6. First-run setup for Vundle??
7. Add bits I think I need to BasicTex
8. Atom extensions
9. reinstall home, etc from backup

To get the correct prompt, set hostname in Sys Prefs/Sharing, and also do
$ sudo scutil --set HostName <newname>

log in to dropbox & wait for sync
Install 1password
Install solarized from the web
install vundle from github

Try this to set up solarized in vim & tmux:
